## Project Overview
This project transforms unstructured Sephora customer reviews into a powerful strategic asset. The primary objective was to move beyond simple star ratings and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the *why* behind customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. By building a high-performance sentiment classification model, this analysis quantifies product risk, uncovers key drivers of customer sentiment, and provides a series of data-driven recommendations for Marketing, R&D, and Product teams.

## Methodology
1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** Loaded and merged multiple datasets, then performed rigorous text preprocessing (lemmatization, stopword removal) to create a clean corpus for analysis.  
2. **Modeling:**
   - Established a **Logistic Regression** baseline with TF-IDF features.
   - Fine-tuned a state-of-the-art **DistilBERT** transformer model for high-precision sentiment classification.  
3. **Deep-Dive Analysis:** Used the validated model and cleaned data to conduct a series of strategic deep dives into the drivers of business value and risk.

## Key Findings & Actionable Insights

### 1. Strategic Risk Matrix: Diagnosing Product Failures
- Products plotted by **failure rate vs. financial impact**.
- **Critical Priority:** High-revenue, high-failure products (e.g., *Protini Polypeptide Moisturizer*).  
- **Protect the Stars:** High-revenue, low-failure products.  

**Actionable Insight:** R&D and Quality Control must investigate **Critical Priority** products immediately.

### 2. Financial Risk by Customer Concerns
- **Highest Revenue Risk:** Acne-related complaints â†’ **\$140,000+** estimated revenue risk.  
- **Other Notable Risks:** Sensitivity and pore-related complaints â†’ moderate but significant revenue risk.  

**Actionable Insight:**  
- **R&D:** Reformulate high-revenue products to reduce acne triggers, sensitivity, and pore issues.  
- **Marketing & Customer Support:** Proactively address concerns via education, ingredient transparency, and targeted campaigns.

### 3. The Financial Engine: Mid-Range is the Market Leader
- **Mid-Range price tier ($25-$75)** drives over **55% of total estimated revenue**.
- Strong combination of pricing and review volume makes this segment Sephora's core financial driver.  

**Actionable Insight:** Prioritize Mid-Range tier in marketing campaigns, inventory management, and customer acquisition strategies.

### 4. The Myth of Price vs. Quality is Busted
- **Price has near-zero correlation with customer satisfaction** across all tiers (Budget â†’ Ultra-Luxury).  

**Actionable Insight:** Focus marketing on **tangible benefits, proven ingredients, and problem-solving capabilities**, not premium price as a proxy for quality.

### 5. Ingredient Connection: Data-Driven Formulation
- **"Hero" Ingredients:** Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramides, Squalane â†’ higher ratings.  
- **"Villain" Ingredient:** Alcohol â†’ largest driver of dissatisfaction.  

**Actionable Insight:**  
- **R&D:** Prioritize hero ingredients, reduce/eliminate alcohol.  
- **Marketing:** Highlight data-backed attributes in campaigns.
